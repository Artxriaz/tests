I want to write towards the love of my life, Samatha. When I was a young lad, made of snow i feel in love with this girl, she was gorgeous and yet ugly. I don't know how is it even possible to explain this phenomenon to the world, but i can simply say I'm gay. Being gay is so much better then being straight, because you date someone of the same sexuality rather then someone who you dont even know how big they big are. I don't know anymore what im doing with my life, i deeply apologize to the one reading this message, sincerary. I love you all and I want to die in peace with the one i call Samatha, because she is the love of my life and i can't do anything without her. Because im simply fricking gay for her and for my neighbor which has a crush on a vietnamese girl called Tuti because her real name is even harder to pronounce the most females because of her origins. I love her also very much but i want her to know i want to frick her in bed everyday of the night rap tap tap. Owo notices your bulge, its so big i wanna cuddle in it Samantha, ty.
